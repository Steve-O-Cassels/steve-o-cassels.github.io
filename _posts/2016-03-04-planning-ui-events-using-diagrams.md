## Test driving Plant-UML in Atom.io

I'm using a node module from Neil Crawford to ease the creation of software diagrams using [Plant UML](http://plantuml.com/), Neil blogged about it on [tech.findmypast.com](http://tech.findmypast.com/a-picture-tells-a-thousand-words/) where he covered set-up in Atom.io so I'll not repeat that here.

The bonus PlantUML brings is the speed and clarity with which concepts can be created; text based image authoring really encourages iterating and boosts creativity as we search for meaning.

PlantUML is easy to learn and I've enjoyed creating the following diagrams.

### Modelling Activity Diagrams
