The pace of change in software delivery means we often find ourselves using a framework or language for short periods.  As time goes on the driver for changing what we use to deliver products may vary but the upshot is the same, a constant in this developer’s life is learning the next new thing.

If we approached how we deliver learning-to-ourselves in the same way we deliver software products, we’d adopt practices from Lean Engineering like Kata’s, iteration, short sprints with shorter feedback loops, removing blockers, avoiding unplanned work, moving the chair out the way and so on; we’d manage it professionally.  The fact that we own and manage our learning goes without saying and at its very essence is the requirement to continually improve our learning strategies – cos we’re all busy and time is finite.

There are also the thorny issues of motivation and retention that need to have their say on our strategy.

## Retention
Inefficient learners often try a simple strategy of memorising by repetition – like cramming for an exam – which we all know doesn’t retain well over longer periods.  As Developers we need to memorise abstract facts like CLI or Git commands or language features; we could use mnemonics or we could use a [spaced repetition learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) system like the open source  [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) where efficient learning is derived by only practising the material you are about to forget.

[www.khanacademy.org](https://www.khanacademy.org/) has a similarly clever strategy of identifying what you find hard and bombarding you with questions (and tutorials) in that problem space until you can complete the question whilst also periodically questioning you on things you appear to know well to help ensure your short term learning becomes long term knowledge.

Whilst Anki is great for retention of learnt (grocked) knowledge using short focused 10 minute top-up sessions every day, Khan Academy has a different purpose altogther as it invokes several learning strategies involving problem solving, repetition, examples and tutorials and does all this with short feedback loops.  

There are many similar models of learning via Katas on sites like PluralSight and CodeSchool (learn by doing).

When we are busy and our entire bank of learning-time happens to fall within our commute we could adopt an ostensibly efficient strategy of reading books on language X or process Y, and for a change from reading maybe gorge ourselves on podcasts.  Thinking back to that old adage that students only retain ten minutes of a sixty minute lecture and applying that evaluation to the act of reading a book, it’s obvious we need to do more than just read it.  We need to synthesise the ideas and make them our own.

It gets interesting when we realise we need active, participatory learning – or to be all fancy about it, when we consider Metacognitive (big thinking) strategies – to a greater or lesser extent,  Anki, KhanAcademy, PluralSight and CodeSchool all invoke this.

## Efficient Learning
If we take an analogy from the Arts and Social Sciences, the strategy there is to read, then summarise and then use creative writing to formulate an opinion in our own words, but why?  It’s the thought process behind formulating and arranging our own-words that is critical.  Short term memory prevents us from transcribing a 3000 word piece sequentially in one go,  instead we iterate over our creation, entering a polishing phase as we look for meaning by re-arrange paragraphs, re-wording ( sounds like refactoring) and this iteration mirrors efficient learning.

Efficient learning then, is a combination of creative thinking, bolstered by repetition and backed up by spaced repetition of things you have already learnt to transfer them or maintain them in long term memory.

### My experience and motivation
Of course there is no right answer - only to keep trying new things..

I’ve tried Kata’s on varying sites to learn a new language (only to promptly
forget what I learnt), indeed I admit I’ve crammed for Microsoft Exams (yip the knowledge went the same way as the Katas) but what I enjoy and retain the most is borne from both blogging and building a product in a side project - thank you Git!

It’s truly creative so I am more engaged and has orthogonal benefits like

*	Delivering something instead of just the solution to a kata
*	Satisfaction from sharing and getting feedback from the developer community

Blogging about the side project helps – even if you have a readership of one you’ll learn because you become your own critic and just like [rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) it invokes the benefits of creative writing as you pursue the expression of the ideas in your head.
