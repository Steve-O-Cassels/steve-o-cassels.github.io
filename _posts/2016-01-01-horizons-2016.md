## Looking back
When reviewing my work and learning habits I conclude that my learning was not the most efficient or engaged. I hope to ameliorate that this year.  I transitioned from a Test role back to full stack development after a hiatus of 18 months.

### Books
Looking back at 2015 there are a bunch of books I've enjoyed that influenced my work habits; I have to admit some were not for me and did not get cover to cover treatment...

#### Team and soft skills

Of these, the following two were gold and I thoroughly recommend them:


* [The Pheonix Project](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262509/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1451694044&sr=8-1&keywords=the+pheonix+project).
  * Easy to read and a great way to learn.
* [The Five dysfunctions of a Team](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Lencioni/dp/0787960756/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1451694208&sr=8-1&keywords=the+five+dysfunctions+of+a+team) by Patrick Lencioni.
  * Very absorbing and a title to be revisited periodically.

#### Technical
* [Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1451694844&sr=8-1&keywords=clean+code) by Uncle Bob.
* [Adaptive Code via C#: Class and Interface Design, Design Patterns, and SOLID Principles](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Adaptive-Code-via-Interface-Principles/dp/0735683204/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1451694896&sr=8-1&keywords=adaptive+code+via+c) by Gary McLean Hall.  

### Refactoring my learning
* Started to summarise books using Mind maps - see Software
* Playing with [spaced-repetition-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) using [Anki](https://ankiweb.net) and flash-cards.
* Paying attention to [ThoughtWorks Technology Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar#/)  

### Software I started using
* [MindMup](http://www.mindmup.com), the free, open source mind map tool built on HTML 5 by Gojko Adzic.
* NodeJs
* MySQL
* ReactJs, Flux, Alt
* Jekyll
* GitHub's [Atom](https://atom.io/) editor has become my favourite.

### Practises that I grocked
* Lean Engineering
* TDD
* SOLID

## Looking forward into 2016
I have a bunch of avenues for study this year...

### Learning in 2016
* Build real software instead of kata's
* Learn Functional programming with Elixir
* Follow [David Thomas](http://pragdave.me/), author of [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/book/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer)
  * Author of [CodeKata](http://codekata.com/)
* Give Anki a real trial

### Books on my 2016 shortlist
* [Pragmatic thinking and learning](https://pragprog.com/book/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning)
* [And a bunch of other Pragmatic Programmer titles touching Pheonix, Elixir...](https://pragprog.com/titles?f[sort_by]=pubdate&f[category]=all&f[skill_level]=All&f[title_contains]=)
