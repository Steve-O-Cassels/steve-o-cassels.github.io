# Vertically Compliant

This site is built on the great work of others in the community.

## Site Design
I started with the [Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes) theme, a two column responsive Jekyll theme perfect for powering your GitHub hosted blog.

## Minimal Mistakes is all about:

* Responsive templates. Looking good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
* Gracefully degrading in older browsers. Compatible with Internet Explorer 8+ and all modern browsers.
* Minimal embellishments -- content first.
* Optional large feature images for posts and pages.
* Simple and clear permalink structure.
* [Custom 404 page](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/404.html) to get you started.
* Support for Disqus Comments

See a [live version of Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) hosted on GitHub.

## Page Speed
* [x] CSS compressed
  * This is achieved out of the box with Minimal Mistakes theme - see config.yaml
* [x] Minified HTML
  * Thanks to [Anatol Broder](https://github.com/penibelst) for making this a simple setup with his [Jeykll Compress](https://github.com/penibelst/jekyll-compress-html).
