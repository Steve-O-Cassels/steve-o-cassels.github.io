Vertical-Compliance is a term to describe the comfort of a carbon fibre bike frame - good [vertical compliance](https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?hl=en#hl=en&q=vertical+compliance) is a way of saying the frame is comfortable.  This is my coding playground and something I hope you find to be comfortable.  

## Vertical Compliance is all about:

* Bike related code samples.
* Web based.
* Content about coding.
* Pleasing my reader, CTO and tester.
